## General Invitation for Submission

The Student Research Workshop provides a venue for student researchers to present their work in computational linguistics and natural language processing. Students receive feedback from the general conference audience as well as from mentors specifically assigned according to the topic of their work.

We invite papers in three different categories:

1. *Thesis proposals*. This category is appropriate for advanced students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work.
2. *Research papers*. Papers in this category can describe completed work, or work in progress with preliminary results. For these papers, the first author must be a current graduate student.
3. *Special undergraduate track*. In order to encourage undergraduate research, we are offering a special track for research papers where the first author is an undergraduate student.

Topics of interest for the SRW are the same as NAACL main conference. See the [main call for papers](call-for-papers.html) for a list of topics.

## Benefits of Participation

- All accepted papers will be presented in the main conference poster session giving students an opportunity to interact with and present their work to a large and diverse audience, including top researchers in the field. 
- All accepted papers (thesis, research, undergraduate) will be published in the NAACL 2015 SRW Proceedings.
- Each participant is also assigned a mentor – an experienced researcher – who can provide valuable advice. 
- Additional feedback is being planned for thesis proposals.

## Submission Requirements

All research papers should follow the two-column format of the [NAACL HLT 2015 proceedings](call-for-papers.html). All papers will have a maximum limit of 6 pages for content, with additional pages for references.

Submissions must conform to the specifications of [NAACL HLT 2015 call for papers](call-for-papers.html) regarding multiple submissions and preparing papers for the double-blind review process. Click the Submissions guidelines link to the left for more information.
