# Joint Call for Workshops Proposals: NAACL/ACL/EMNLP&nbsp;2015

The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), and the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) invite proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with NAACL 2015, ACL 2015, or EMNLP 2015. We solicit proposals on any topic of interest to the ACL communities. Workshops will be held at one of the following conference venues:

**NAACL 2015** is the Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL). It will be held in Denver, Colorado May 31 - June 5. The NAACL workshops will be held on June 4-5. The webpage for NAACL 2015 is: <{{ site.url }}>.

**ACL 2015** is the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. It will be held in Beijing, China, August 15-20, 2015. The dates for the ACL workshops will be August 20-21: <http://acl2015.org/>.

**EMNLP 2015** is the SIGDAT conference on Empirical Methods for Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). It started in 1993 with the series of Workshops on Very Large Corpora and was renamed EMNLP in 1996. The main conference will be held in Lisbon, Portugal, September 17-21, 2015. The dates for the EMNLP workshops are still not definitive, most likely they will be September 17 and September 21.

Proposals will be reviewed jointly by the Workshop Co-Chairs of the three conferences.

## SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Proposals for workshops should contain:

1. A title and brief (2-page max) description of the workshop topic and content.
2. The desired workshop length (one or two days) and an estimate of the number of attendees.
3. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of the organizers, with one-paragraph statements of their research interests and areas of expertise.
4. A list of Programme Committee members, with an indication of which members have already agreed. It is highly desirable for proposals to have at least 75% of the Programme Committee reviewers confirmed at the time of the submission. Organizers should do their best to estimate the number of submissions (especially for recurring workshops) in order to (a) ensure a sufficient number of reviewers so that each paper receives 3 reviews, and (b) anticipate that no one is committed to reviewing more than 2 papers. This practice is likely to ensure on-time, and more thorough and thoughtful reviews. Submissions should essentially be ready to be turned into a Call for Workshop Papers within one week of notification (see Timelines).
5. A description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop.
6. A description of special requirements for technical needs.
7. A note specifying which venue(s) (NAACL/ACL/EMNLP) would be acceptable and/or preferable.

Workshop co-chairs will review the quality of the workshop proposals. Once the reviews are complete, the workshop co-chairs will work together to assign workshops to the three conferences, taking into account the location preferences and constraints provided by the workshop proposers.

The ACL has a set of policies on workshops.
You can find the ACL's general policies on workshops, the financial policy for workshops, and the financial policy for SIG workshops at:

- <http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/Workshops/workshop-support-general-policy.html>
- <http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/Workshops/workshop-conf-financial-policy.html>
- <http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/Workshops/workshops-Sig-financial-policy.html>

Proposals may be submitted as Plain text, MS Word, or PDF documents (preferably PDF). Proposals should be attached and emailed to the workshop organizers (naacl.acl.emnlp.w15@gmail.com) no later than 18 October 2014, Samoa Standard Time (SST) (UTC/GMT-11). *You should receive a confirmation of proposal receipt within 24 hours. If you do not, please get in touch with Sebastian Riedel:s.riedel@ucl.ac.uk*

Notification of acceptance of workshop proposals will occur no later than 2 November 2014.

Organizers of accepted proposals will be responsible for publicizing and running the workshop, including reviewing submissions, producing the camera ready workshop proceedings, and organizing the meeting days. It is crucial that organizers commit to all deadlines. In particular, failure to produce the camera ready proceedings on time will lead to the exclusion of the workshop from the CD-ROM/USB & unified author indexes. Workshop organizers cannot accept for publication papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, although they are free to set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. Since the conferences will occur at different times, the timescales for the submission and reviewing of workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be different for each conference. Suggested timescales for each of the conferences are given below. Workshop organizers should not deviate from this schedule unless absolutely necessary.
