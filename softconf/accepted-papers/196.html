<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper describes a joint model of word segmentation and phonological alternations, which takes unsegmented utterances as input and infers word segmentations and underlying phonological representations. The model is a Maximum Entropy or log-linear model, which can express a probabilistic version of Optimality Theory &#40;OT; Prince 2004&#41;, a standard phonological framework. The features in our model are inspired by OT's Markedness and Faithfulness constraints. Following the OT principle that such features indicate ``violations'', we require their weights to be non-positive. We apply our model to a modified version of the Buckeye corpus &#40;Pitt 2007&#41; in which the only phonological alternations are deletions of word-final /d/ and /t/ segments. The model sets a new state-of-the-art for this corpus for word segmentation, identification of underlying forms, and identification of /d/ and /t/ deletions.
<p>
 We also show that the OT-inspired sign constraints on feature weights are crucial for accurate identification of deleted /d/s; without them our model posits approximately 10 times more deleted underlying /d/s than appear in the manually annotated data. </p>
