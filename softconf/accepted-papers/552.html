<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Tree trimming is the problem of extracting an optimal subtree from an input  tree, and sentence extraction and sentence compression methods can be  formulated and solved as tree trimming problems. Previous approaches  require integer linear programming &#40;ILP&#41; solvers to obtain exact solutions.  The problem of this approach is that ILP solvers are black-boxes and have  no theoretical guarantee as to their computation complexity.  We propose a  dynamic programming &#40;DP&#41; algorithm for tree trimming problems whose running  time is O&#40;NL log N&#41;, where N is the number of tree nodes and L  is the length limit.  Our algorithm exploits the zero-suppressed binary  decision diagram &#40;ZDD&#41;, a data structure that represents a family of sets  as a directed acyclic graph, to represent the set of subtrees in a compact  form; the structure of ZDD permits the application of DP to obtain  exact solutions, and our algorithm is applicable to different tree trimming  problems.  Moreover, experiments show that our algorithm is faster than  state-of-the-art ILP solvers, and that it scales well to handle large  summarization problems. </p>
