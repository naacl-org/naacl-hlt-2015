<h4>Semi-Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation Using Word Embeddings in General and Specific Domains</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>One of the weaknesses of current supervised word sense disambiguation &#40;WSD&#41; systems is that they only treat a word as a discrete entity. However, a continuous-space representation of words &#40;word embeddings&#41; can provide valuable information and thus improve generalization accuracy. Since word embeddings are typically obtained from unlabeled data using unsupervised methods, this method can be seen as a semi-supervised word sense disambiguation approach. This paper investigates two ways of incorporating word embeddings in a word sense disambiguation setting and evaluates these two methods on some SensEval/SemEval lexical sample and all-words tasks and also a domain-specific lexical sample task. The obtained results show that such representations consistently improve the accuracy of the selected supervised WSD system. Moreover, our experiments on a domain-specific dataset show that our supervised baseline system beats the best knowledge-based systems by a large margin. </p>
