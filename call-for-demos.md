# NAACL HLT 2015 CALL FOR DEMONSTRATIONS

The NAACL 2015 Program Committee invites proposals for Demonstrations to be displayed at NAACL HLT 2015. We encourage submissions from early prototype demonstrations to mature production-ready systems; of particular interest are demos that can be openly used by NAACL attendees from the conference website before and during the conference. All accepted demos will be published in a companion volume of the conference proceedings, and will be presented during a demo session (with an optional poster).

## Areas of Interest

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following types of systems:

- End-to-end systems:
  - Mobile applications of language technologies
  - Text- or speech-based information access or dialogue systems
  - Machine translation systems for consumer or industry applications
  - Question answering applications
  - Information extraction
  - Systems for meeting capture and analysis
  - NLP and speech technologies to support accessibility and assistive devices
- Systems aiding research and development:
  - Software architectures and reusable components for use in NLP
  - Tools for data visualization
  - Software tools for system evaluation or error analysis
  - Interfaces and resources to support linguistic annotation
  - Toolkits for machine learning, NLP, or data mining
- Systems supporting learning or education:
  - Visual interactive aids for students
  - Tutorial agents to support real-time feedback for learning
  - Instructional aids for topics in computational linguistics
  - Systems to score or critique textual student responses
  - Systems to mine textual or behavioral data for educational purposes

## Format for Submission

Please use the main NAACL paper style (<http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs>) and submission guidelines. At a minimum, demo proposals should include the following:

- A brief description of the technical content to be demonstrated.
- A "script outline" of the demo presentation, including accompanying narrative, and either a Web address for accessing the demo or visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams).

As the reviewing will be blind, proposals must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the authorâ€™s identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". In addition, please do not post your proposals on the web until after the review process is complete.

The entire proposal must not be more than four pages. We will reject without review any papers that do not follow the official style guidelines, anonymity conditions and page limits. Also, please note that no hardware or software will be provided by the local organizers. 

## Submissions Procedure

Proposals must be submitted electronically by February 13, 2015 using submission software available at <https://www.softconf.com/naacl2015/demos>.

## Important Dates

All times are 11:59pm PST on the deadline day

- Submission deadline: February 13, 2015
- Notification of acceptance: March 15, 2015
- Submission of camera ready copies: March 30, 2015

## Further Details

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their relevance to computational linguistics, innovation, scientific contribution, presentation, as well as potential logistical constraints. Accepted submissions will be allocated four pages in the Companion Volume to the Proceedings of the Conference. Further details on the date, time, and format of the demonstration session(s) will be determined and provided at a later date.

Please send any inquiries to the demonstration co-chairs:
