<h1>NAACL HLT 2015 CALL FOR PAPERS</h1>

<h3>The 2015 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics - Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT 2015)</h3>

<h3>May 31 to June 5, 2015.</h3>

<h3>Denver, Colorado, United States</h3>

<h3>http://naacl.org/naacl-hlt-2015</h3>

<p>The NAACL HLT 2015 conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines
aimed at: building intelligent systems to interact with humans using
natural language; understanding computational and other linguistic
properties of languages; and enhancing human-human communication
through speech recognition, automatic translation, information
retrieval, text summarization, and information extraction.</p>

<p>NAACL HLT 2015 will feature long papers, short papers, demonstrations,
and a student research workshop, as well as associated tutorials
and workshops. In addition, some of the presentations at the
conference will be of papers accepted for the new Transactions of
the ACL journal (http://www.transacl.org/).  </p>

<p>The conference invites the submission of long and short papers on
substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of
automated language processing, including language resources. The
short paper format may also be appropriate for a small, focused
contribution, a work in progress, a negative result, an opinion
piece or an interesting application nugget.  Topics include, but
are not limited to, the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
(including spoken and multimodal dialogue systems) </li>
<li>Discourse and Pragmatics </li>
<li>Generation and Summarization </li>
<li>Information Extraction and Question Answering </li>

<li>Spoken Language Processing </li>
<li>Tagging, Chunking, Syntax and Parsing </li>
<li>Text Categorization and Topic Models </li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<h3>Long Papers</h3>

<p>NAACL HLT 2015 submissions must describe substantial, original,
completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete
evaluation and analysis should be included. The long paper deadline
is December 4, 2014 by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8).
Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, originality/innovativeness,
soundness/correctness, impact, meaningful comparison, thoroughness,
replicability and clarity. Each submission will be reviewed by at
least three program committee members.</p>

<p>Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus
2 pages for references.  Upon acceptance, final versions of long
papers will be given one additional page (up to 9 pages with 2 pages
for references) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into
account.</p>

<p>Papers will be presented orally or as a poster presentation as
determined by the program committee.  The decisions as to which
papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations
will be based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work.
There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers
presented orally and those presented as poster presentations.</p>

<h3>Short Papers</h3>

<p>NAACL HLT 2015 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions
must describe original and unpublished work. The short paper deadline
this year is also December 4, 2014 by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time
(GMT-8). Characteristics of past short papers include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A small, focused contribution </li>
<li>Work in progress</li>
<li>A negative result</li>
<li>An opinion piece </li>
<li>An interesting application nugget</li>
</ul>

<p>Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus
2 pages for references.  Upon acceptance, short papers will be given
five (5) pages in the proceedings and 2 pages for references.
Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address
reviewers comments in their final versions.</p>

<p>Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions.
While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the
proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between
short papers presented orally and those presented as poster
presentations. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at
least two program committee members.</p>

<h3>Electronic Submission</h3>

<p>Papers should be submitted electronically using the Softconf START
conference management system at the following URL:</p>

<p>https://www.softconf.com/naacl2015/papers</p>

<p>The site will be open for accepting submissions two months before
the conference deadline.</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Long paper and short paper submissions should follow the two-column
format of NAACL HLT 2015 proceedings, where long papers should not
exceed eight (8) pages of and short papers should not exceed four
(4) pages of content. Page limits must be strictly observed.</p>

<p>Submissions should use the ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word
style files tailored for this year's conference; these style files
are available at the following URL:</p>

<p>http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs/</p>

<p>Paper submissions must be electronically submitted in PDF format
and must conform to the official style guidelines provided in the
PDF file below:</p>

<p>http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs/naaclhlt2015.pdf</p>

<p>Even if you've submitted to NAACL before, please read the guidelines
regarding grayscale readability.  NAACL is enforcing grayscale
readability of all figure and graphics as an aid to the color-blind
and to those reading papers printed on B&amp;W printers. Please check
to make sure that all figures and graphics in this paper interpretable.</p>

<h3>Double-blind Review Process</h3>

<p>As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the
authors' names and affiliations.  Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith,
1991) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." Papers that do not conform to
these requirements will be rejected without review. In addition,
please do not post your submissions on the web until after the
review process is complete (in special cases this is permitted: see
the multiple submission policy below).</p>

<p>We will reject without review any papers that do not follow the
official style guidelines, anonymity conditions and page limits.</p>

<h3>Multiple Submission Policy</h3>

<p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must indicate this at submission time. Authors of
papers accepted for presentation at NAACL HLT 2015 must notify the
program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper
will be presented. All accepted papers must be presented at the
conference to appear in the proceedings. We will not accept for
publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in
content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Preprint servers such as arXiv.org and ACL-related workshops that
do not have published proceedings in the ACL Anthology are not
considered archival for purposes of submission. Authors must state
in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint
server and title of the non-archival version.  The submitted version
should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the
prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: "The author(s)
have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version
of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved
submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit
of blind review, the current submission does not reference the
non-archival version." Reviewers are free to do what they like with
this information.</p>

<p>Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL HLT must ensure
that submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other
in content or results. Authors should not submit short and long
versions of papers with substantial overlap in their original
contributions.</p>
