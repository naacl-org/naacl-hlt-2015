# Workshops

The [*Student Research Workshop*]({{ site.links.srw }}) provides a venue for student researchers to present their work in computational linguistics and natural language processing. Students receive feedback from the general conference audience as well as from mentors specifically assigned according to the topic of their work.

Furthermore, NAACL HLT 2015 will host 14 workshops and one co-located conference:
