# Joint Call for Tutorial Proposals: NAACL/ACL/EMNLP&nbsp;2015

The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational
Linguistics (NAACL), the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL),
and the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing
(EMNLP) invite proposals for tutorials to be held in conjunction with
NAACL 2015, ACL 2015, or EMNLP 2015. We seek proposals for tutorials in
all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include
disciplines such as linguistics, speech, information retrieval and
multimodal processing. We particularly welcome (1) tutorials that cover
advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any
NAACL/ACL/EMNLP related tutorial, or (2) tutorials that provide
introductions into related fields that are potentially relevant for the CL
community (e.g. bioinformatics, social media, human language processing,
machine learning techniques).
Tutorials will be held at one of the following conference venues:

**NAACL 2015** is the Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the
Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL). It will be held in
Denver, Colorado May 31-June 5, 2015. The NAACL tutorials will be held
on May 31. The webpage for NAACL 2015 is: <{{ site.url }}>.

**ACL 2015** is the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics. It will be held in Beijing, China, July 26-31, 2015. The
ACL tutorials will be held on July 26. ACL webpage: <http://acl2015.org/>.

**EMNLP 2015** is the SIGDAT conference on Empirical Methods for Natural
Language Processing (EMNLP). The main conference will be held in Lisbon,
Portugal, September 17-21, 2015. The EMNLP tutorials will be held on
September 17.

## REMUNERATION

Information on the payment for tutorial instructors can be found in the
[ACL Tutorial Teacher Payment Policy](
http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Tutorial_teacher_payment_policy).
Please note: remuneration for Tutorial presenters is fixed according to
the above policy and does not cover registration fees for the main
conference.

## SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals for tutorials should contain:

1. A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the ACL community (not more than 2 pages).
2. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the tutorial's core content can be covered in a three-hour slot (including a coffee break). In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are available as well.
3. The names, affiliations, email addresses and websites of the tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of their research interests and areas of expertise.
4. A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an estimate of the audience size.
5. A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g., internet access).
6. A note specifying which venue(s) (NAACL/ACL/EMNLP) would be acceptable and/or preferable.

Tutorial proposals should be submitted online by January 9, 2015 through the
START system. The URL for the START submission system will be posted on
the conference websites. Proposals will be reviewed jointly by the
Tutorial Co-Chairs of the three conferences.

## TUTORIAL SPEAKER RESPONSIBILITIES

Accepted tutorial speakers will be notified by Friday, February 6, 2015,
and must then provide abstracts of their tutorials for inclusion in the
conference registration material by the corresponding deadlines. The
description should be in two formats: an ASCII version that can be
included in email announcements and published on the conference website,
and a PDF version for inclusion in the electronic proceedings (detailed
instructions will be provided). Tutorial speakers must provide tutorial
materials, at least containing copies of the course slides as well as a
bibliography for the material covered in the tutorial, by the deadlines
specified for the three conferences.
