# Guidelines for Oral Presentations

## How long is an oral presentation? 

Presentation time is 25 minutes for LONG papers and 15 minutes for SHORT papers, including introductions, questions and switching between presentations. Please limit your talk to 20 minutes if you have a long paper and 12 minutes if you have a short paper. It is important that the sessions remain on time. 

## When should I test my presentation? 

Please make sure you hook up your laptop and run a test before the presentation.  You can do this during the break preceding your talk or during the half hour before the first afternoon session begins.  You should arrive to your session room 15 minutes before the session starts to meet with your session chair.

## What will be available in the conference room? 

You are expected to bring your own laptop. Presentation rooms will each have several connections for laptops (VGA cable, mini D-sub 15 pin).  Technical staff will be on hand to assist you. Your session chair will help switch the display to your laptop for your presentation. 

## What else do I need to bring? 

Please remember to bring your own AC adapter. If your laptop is not compatible with a VGA cable, please also bring the required VGA adapter.  

## Will my talk be video recorded? 

Yes. Like at NAACL 2013 and ACL2014, we will record all of the oral presentations at NAACL 2015. We have hired a professional videographer to record the presentations. We will make the videos available online after the conference. Our goal is to improve the dissemination of the scientific materials that are generated for the conference.  The copyright agreement for the final submission of your paper granted ACL permissions to record your talk and distribute it under a Creative Commons Attribution License.  However, if you want to opt out, you can email naacl2015-programchairs@googlegroups.com after the conference to have your talk removed from the archive.

# Guidelines for Poster Presentations

## When to set up the poster? 

Tables/posterboards will be set up by lunchtime each day.  You should be able to affix your poster to the posterboard anytime between 1pm and the beginning of the poster session on the day your poster is scheduled. The assignment of tables to posters can be found in the registration package. 

## What will be provided for each poster? 

1. A self-standing posterboard measuring 4 feet wide and 3 feet high.
2. A table 6 feet long and 18 inches deep where the poster board will stand.  There will also be room on the table for laptops and/or handouts.
3. One chair for each poster.
4. Clips, double-sided tape and poster putty will be available to affix posters to the posterboards.

## Am I expected to participate in the one-minute madness (OMM) session for posters? 

Due to the large number of posters this year, we are only able to accommodate long paper posters and TACL paper posters in an OMM session. Joel Tetreault is the OMM session chair. He will be in touch with detailed instructions about the one-minute madness session.
