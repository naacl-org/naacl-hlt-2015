Generate the schedule in the `Schedule Maker` tab and then download
the `accepted.zip` file using the `Download an archive` option.
Unzip it into this directory: `accepted`.  

Delete all the PDF files if any were part of the zip file.

## Important

The schedule needs to be integrated into the main website
by generating the files `schedule.md` and `authorindex.md`.

This is done by calling `python generate-schedule.py`.
