instructors to learn the latest country line dancing, then practice
your moves to the sounds of a local DJ (who will play other sounds
if you tire of the country twang).  Enjoy networking with colleagues
and have a relaxing evening!  (We are trying a second-time experiment
in holding a 2nd poster dinner and open-to-all desserts/drinks/dancing
social event combination in place of the usual Banquet).  We hope
