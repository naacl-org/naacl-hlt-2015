<blockquote>
  <p>The 2015 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics - Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT 2015)</p>

  <p>May 31 to June 5, 2015.</p>

  <p>Denver, Colorado, United States</p>

  <p><a href="http://naacl.org/2015">http://naacl.org/2015</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NAACL HLT 2015 conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines aimed at: building intelligent systems to interact with humans using natural language; understanding computational and other linguistic properties of languages; and enhancing human-human communication through speech recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, text summarization, and information extraction.</p>

<p>NAACL HLT 2015 will feature long papers, short papers, demonstrations, and a student research workshop, as well as associated tutorials and workshops. In addition, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted for the new Transactions of the ACL journal (<a href="http://www.transacl.org/">http://www.transacl.org/</a>).</p>

<p>The conference invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of automated language processing, including language resources. The short paper format may also be appropriate for a small, focused contribution, a work in progress, a negative result, an opinion piece or an interesting application nugget. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dialogue and Interactive Systems (including spoken and multimodal dialogue systems)</li>
  <li>Discourse and Pragmatics</li>
  <li>Generation and Summarization</li>
  <li>Information Extraction and Question Answering</li>
  <li>Information Retrieval</li>
  <li>Language Resources and Evaluation</li>
  <li>Language and Vision</li>
  <li>Linguistic and Psycholinguistic Aspects of CL</li>

  <li>NLP-enabled Technology</li>
  <li>Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation</li>
  <li>Semantics</li>
  <li>Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining</li>
  <li>Spoken Language Processing</li>
  <li>Tagging, Chunking, Syntax and Parsing</li>
  <li>Text Categorization and Topic Models</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Deadline for BOTH Long and Short paper submission: Dec 4, 2014</li>
  <li>Author response period: Jan 22-28, 2015</li>
  <li>Notification to authors: Feb 20, 2015</li>
  <li>Camera ready papers due: Mar 20, 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>All deadlines are 11:59PM Pacific Time. Please DO NOT submit the same paper in long and short paper form. (See Multiple Submission policy section.)</p>

<h2 id="submissions">Submissions</h2>

<h3 id="long-papers">Long Papers</h3>

<p>NAACL HLT 2015 submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. The long paper deadline is December 4, 2014 by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8). Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, originality/innovativeness, soundness/correctness, impact, meaningful comparison, thoroughness, replicability and clarity. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.</p>

<p>Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus 2 pages for references. Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers will be given one additional page (up to 9 pages with 2 pages for references) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.</p>

<p>Papers will be presented orally or as a poster presentation as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and those presented as poster presentations.</p>

<h3 id="short-papers">Short Papers</h3>

<p>NAACL HLT 2015 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. The short paper deadline this year is also December 4, 2014 by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8). Characteristics of past short papers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A small, focused contribution</li>
  <li>Work in progress</li>
  <li>A negative result</li>
  <li>An opinion piece</li>
  <li>An interesting application nugget</li>
</ul>

<p>Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus 2 pages for references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) pages in the proceedings and 2 pages for references. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers comments in their final versions.</p>

<p>Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and those presented as poster presentations. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members.</p>

<h3 id="electronic-submission">Electronic Submission</h3>
<p>Papers should be submitted electronically using the Softconf START conference management system at the following URL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.softconf.com/naacl2015/papers">https://www.softconf.com/naacl2015/papers</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The site will be open for accepting submissions two months before the conference deadline.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>

<p>Long paper and short paper submissions should follow the two-column format of NAACL HLT 2015 proceedings, where long papers should not exceed eight (8) pages of and short papers should not exceed four (4) pages of content. Page limits must be strictly observed.</p>

<p>Submissions should use the ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year’s conference; these style files are available at the following URL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs/">http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paper submissions must be electronically submitted in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines provided in the PDF file below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs/naaclhlt2015.pdf">http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs/naaclhlt2015.pdf</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you’ve submitted to NAACL before, please read the guidelines regarding grayscale readability. NAACL is enforcing grayscale readability of all figure and graphics as an aid to the color-blind and to those reading papers printed on B&amp;W printers. Please check to make sure that all figures and graphics in this paper interpretable.</p>

<h3 id="double-blind-review-process">Double-blind Review Process</h3>

<p>As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. In addition, please do not post your submissions on the web until after the review process is complete (in special cases this is permitted: see the multiple submission policy below).</p>

<p>We will reject without review any papers that do not follow the official style guidelines, anonymity conditions and page limits.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-submission-policy">Multiple Submission Policy</h3>

<p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at NAACL HLT 2015 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.</p>

<p>Preprint servers such as arXiv.org and ACL-related workshops that do not have published proceedings in the ACL Anthology are not considered archival for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title of the non-archival version. The submitted version should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: “The author(s) have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the current submission does not reference the non-archival version.” Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.</p>

<p>Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL HLT must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly (&gt;25%) with each other in content or results. Authors should not submit short and long versions of papers with substantial overlap in their original contributions.</p>
