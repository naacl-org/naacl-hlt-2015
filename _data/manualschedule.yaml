  'Invited Talk by Lillian Lee':
    'title': >
        "Big data pragmatics!", or, "Putting the ACL in computational social science",
        or, if you think these title alternatives could turn people on, turn people off,
        or otherwise have an effect, this talk might be for you.

    'abstract': >
        <p>What effect does language have on people?
        </p><p>
        You might say in response, "Who are you to discuss this problem?"
        and you would be right to do so; this is a Major Question that
        science has been tackling for many years. But as a field, I think
        natural language processing and computational linguistics have much
        to contribute to the conversation, and I hope to encourage the
        community to further address these issues.
        </p><p>
        This talk will focus on the effect of phrasing, emphasizing aspects
        that go beyond just the selection of one particular word over
        another.  The issues we'll consider include: Does the way in which
        something is worded in and of itself have an effect on whether it
        is remembered or attracts attention, beyond its content or context?
        Can we characterize how different sides in a debate frame their
        arguments, in a way that goes beyond specific lexical choice (e.g.,
        "pro-choice" vs. "pro-life")?  The settings we'll explore range
        from movie quotes that achieve cultural prominence; to posts on
        Facebook, Wikipedia, Twitter, and the arXiv; to framing in public
        discourse on the inclusion of genetically-modified organisms in
        food.

        Lillian Lee is a professor of computer science and of information
        science at Cornell University, and the co-Editor-in-Chief, together
        with Michael Collins, of Transactions of the ACL.  Her research
        interests include natural language processing and computational
        social science. She is the recipient of the inaugural Best Paper
        Award at HLT-NAACL 2004 (joint with Regina Barzilay), a citation
        in "Top Picks: Technology Research Advances of 2004" by Technology
        Research News (also joint with Regina Barzilay), and an Alfred P.
        Sloan Research Fellowship; and in 2013, she was named a Fellow of
        the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence
        (AAAI). Her group's work has received several mentions in the popular
        press, including The New York Times, NPR's All Things Considered,
        and NBC's The Today Show, and one of her co-authored papers was
        publicly called "boring" by Youtubers Rhett and Link,  in a video
        viewed over 1.8 million times.

  'Invited Talk by Fei-fei Li':
    'title': A Quest for Visual Intelligence in Computers
    'abstract': >
        <p>More than half of the human brain is involved in visual processing.
        While it took mother nature billions of years to evolve and deliver
        us a remarkable human visual system, computer vision is one of the
        youngest disciplines of AI, born with the goal of achieving one of
        the loftiest dreams of AI. The central problem of computer vision
        is to turn millions of pixels of a single image into interpretable
        and actionable concepts so that computers can understand pictures
        just as well as humans do, from objects, to scenes, activities,
        events and beyond. Such technology will have a fundamental impact
        in almost every aspect of our daily life and the society as a whole,
        ranging from e-commerce, image search and indexing, assistive
        technology, autonomous driving, digital health and medicine,
        surveillance, national security, robotics and beyond. In this talk,
        I will give an overview of what computer vision technology is about
        and its brief history. I will then discuss some of the recent work
        from my lab towards large scale object recognition and visual scene
        story telling. I will particularly emphasize on what we call the
        "three pillars" of AI in our quest for visual intelligence: data,
        learning and knowledge. Each of them is critical towards the final
        solution, yet dependent on the other. This talk draws upon a number
        of projects ongoing at the Stanford Vision Lab.
