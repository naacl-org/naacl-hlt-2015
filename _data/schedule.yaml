    'abstract': '<p>We describe the design, development, and API for two discourse parsers for Rhetorical Structure Theory. The two parsers use the same underlying framework, but one uses features that rely on dependency syntax, produced by a fast shift-reduce parser, whereas the other uses a richer feature space, including both constituent- and dependency-syntax and coreference information, produced by the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit. Both parsers obtain state-of-the-art performance, and use a very simple API consisting of, minimally, two lines of Scala code. We accompany this code with a visualization library that runs the two parsers in parallel, and displays the two generated discourse trees side by side, which provides an intuitive way of comparing the two parsers.</p>'

The system covers 13 Indo-Aryan languages, 4 Dravidian languages and English. For training the transliteration systems, we mined parallel transliteration corpora from parallel translation corpora using an unsupervised method and trained statistical transliteration systems using the mined corpora. Languages which do not have a parallel corpora are supported by transliteration through a bridge language. Our script conversion system supports conversion between all Brahmi-derived scripts as well as ITRANS romanization scheme. For this, we leverage co-ordinated Unicode ranges between Indic scripts and use an extended ITRANS encoding for transliterating between English and Indic scripts. The system also provides top-k transliterations and simultaneous transliteration into multiple output languages. We provide a Python as well as REST API to access these services. The API and the mined transliteration corpus are made available for research use under an open source license.</p>'

However, administering an instructor''s prompts, collecting the students'' responses, and summarizing these responses for both instructors and students is challenging and expensive. To address these challenges, we have developed an application called CourseMIRROR (Mobile In-situ Reflections and Review with Optimized Rubrics). CourseMIRROR uses a mobile interface to administer prompts and collect reflective responses for a set of instructor-assigned course lectures. After collection, CourseMIRROR automatically summarizes the reflections with an extractive phrase summarization method, using a clustering algorithm to rank extracted phrases by student coverage. Finally, CourseMIRROR presents the phrase summary to both instructors and students to help them understand the difficulties and misunderstandings encountered.</p>'

Systems that can make use of such information sources exist, but have so far only been tested under very constrained settings, such as WOz interactions. In this paper, we apply to a more complex domain a reference resolution model that works incrementally (i.e., word by word), grounds words with visually present properties of objects (such as shape and size), and can incorporate extra-linguistic information. We find that the model works well compared to previous work on the same data, despite using fewer features.

    'abstract': '<p>Marketing materials such as flyers and other infographics are a vast online resource. In a number of industries, such as the commercial real estate industry, they are in fact the only authoritative source of information. Companies attempting to organize commercial real estate inventories spend a significant amount of resources on manual data entry of this information. In this work, we propose a method for extracting structured data from free-form commercial real estate flyers in PDF and HTML formats. We modeled the problem as text categorization and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks and applied a supervised machine learning approach (Support Vector Machines). Our dataset consists of more than 2,200 commercial real estate flyers and associated manually entered structured data, which was used to automatically create training datasets. Traditionally, text categorization and NER approaches are based on textual information only. However, information in visually rich formats such as PDF and HTML is often conveyed by a combination of textual and visual features. Large fonts, visually salient colors, and positioning often indicate the most relevant pieces of information. We applied novel features based on visual characteristics in addition to traditional text features and show that performance improved significantly for both the text categorization and NER tasks.</p>'

As a specific framework to realize multi-target translation, we expand the formalism of synchronous context-free grammars to handle multiple targets, and describe methods for rule extraction, scoring, pruning, and search with these models.

Both the queries and the collection to be searched are based on Gujarati produced naturally by native speakers; relevance assessment was performed by other native speakers of Gujarati. Ranked retrieval is based on fast acoustic matching that identifies a deeply nested set of matching speech regions, coupled with ways of combining evidence from those matching regions.

Previous works on RNN are based on constituency-based parsing because phrasal nodes in a parse tree can capture compositionality in a sentence. Compared with constituency-based parse trees, dependency graphs can represent relations more compactly. This is particularly important in sentences with distant entities, where the parse tree spans words that are not relevant to the relation. In such cases RNN cannot be trained effectively in a timely manner. However, due to the lack of phrasal nodes in dependency graphs, application of RNN is not straightforward. In order to tackle this problem, we utilize dependency constituent units called chains. Our experiments on two relation classification datasets show that Chain based RNN provides a shallower network, which performs considerably faster and achieves better classification results.</p>'

However, a continuous-space representation of words (word embeddings) can provide valuable information and thus improve generalization accuracy. Since word embeddings are typically obtained from unlabeled data using unsupervised methods, this method can be seen as a semi-supervised word sense disambiguation approach. This paper investigates two ways of incorporating word embeddings in a word sense disambiguation setting and evaluates these two methods on some SensEval/SemEval lexical sample and all-words tasks and also a domain-specific lexical sample task. The obtained results show that such representations consistently improve the accuracy of the selected supervised WSD system. Moreover, our experiments on a domain-specific dataset show that our supervised baseline system beats the best knowledge-based systems by a large margin.</p>'

We first represent each language by continuous latent components that capture feature dependencies. We then combine them with a typology evaluator that distinguishes typologically natural languages from other possible combinations of features. We perform phylogenetic inference in the continuous space and use the evaluator to ensure the typological naturalness of inferred ancestors.

    'abstract': '<p>We present an approach to speech recognition that uses only a neural network to map acoustic input to characters, a character-level language model, and a beam search decoding procedure. This approach eliminates much of the complex infrastructure of modern speech recognition systems, making it possible to directly train a speech recognizer using errors generated by spoken language understanding tasks. The system naturally handles out of vocabulary words and spoken word fragments. We demonstrate our approach using the challenging Switchboard telephone conversation transcription task, achieving a word error rate competitive with existing baseline systems. To our knowledge, this is the first entirely neural-network-based system to achieve strong speech transcription results on a conversational speech task. We analyze qualitative differences between transcriptions produced by our lexicon-free approach and transcriptions produced by a standard speech recognition system. Finally, we evaluate the impact of large context neural network character language models as compared to standard n-gram models within our framework.</p>'

Processing infinite streams of mentions forces us to use a constant amount of memory and so we maintain a representative, fixed sized sample at all times. For the sample to be representative it should represent a large number of entities whilst taking into account both temporal recency and distant references. We introduce new sampling techniques that take into account a notion of streaming discourse (current mentions depend on previous mentions). Using the proposed sampling techniques we are able to get a CEAFe score within 5% of a non-streaming system while using only 30% of the memory.</p>'

    'abstract': "<p>We introduce a distantly supervised event ex- traction approach that extracts complex event templates from microblogs. We show that this near real-time data source is more challeng- ing than news because it contains information that is both approximate (e.g., with values that are close but different from the gold truth) and ambiguous (due to the brevity of the texts), impacting both the evaluation and extraction methods. For the former, we propose a novel, \u201Csoft\u201D, F1 metric that incorporates similarity between extracted fillers and the gold truth, giving partial credit to different but similar values. With respect to extraction method- ology, we propose two extensions to the dis- tant supervision paradigm: to address approx- imate information, we allow positive training examples to be generated from information that is similar but not identical to gold values; to address ambiguity, we aggregate contexts across tweets discussing the same event. We evaluate our contributions on the complex do- main of earthquakes, with events with up to 20 arguments. Our results indicate that, de- spite their simplicity, our contributions yield a statistically-significant improvement of 25% (relative) over a strong distantly-supervised system.

    'abstract': '<p>In modern practice, labeling a dataset often involves aggregating annotator judgments obtained from crowdsourcing. State-of-the-art aggregation is performed via inference on probabilistic models, some of which are data-aware, meaning that they leverage features of the data (e.g., words in a document) in addition to annotator judgments. Previous work largely prefers discriminatively trained conditional models. This paper demonstrates that a data-aware crowdsourcing model incorporating a generative multinomial data model enjoys a strong competitive advantage over its discriminative log-linear counterpart in the typical crowdsourcing setting. That is, the generative approach is better except when the annotators are highly accurate in which case simple majority vote is often sufficient. Additionally, we present a novel mean-field variational inference algorithm for the generative model that significantly improves on the previously reported state-of-the-art for that model. We validate our conclusions on six text classification datasets with both human-generated and synthetic annotations.</p>'

In experiments, we show that combining text and vision helps identifying popular meme descriptions; that our nonparanormal model is able to learn dense and continuous vision features jointly with sparse and discrete text features in a principled manner, outperforming various competitive baselines; that our system can generate meme descriptions using a simple pipeline.</p>'

We find that parser performance on incorrect English sentences, which is standardly ignored in parser evaluation, is key in model selection.

First, the dependency parser can be trained on a training set much larger than the training set for the tree-to-graph algorithm, resulting in a more accurate AMR parser overall. Our parser yields an improvement of 5% absolute in F-measure over the best previous result. Second, the actions that we design are linguistically intuitive and capture the regularities in the mapping between the dependency structure and the AMR of a sentence.

Second, unsupervised domain adaptation is typically treated as a task of moving from a single source to a single target domain. In reality, test data may be diverse, relating to the training data in some ways but not others.

    'abstract': '<p>This paper proposes a novel approach to sentiment analysis that leverages work in sociology on symbolic interactionism. The proposed approach uses Affect Control Theory (ACT) to analyze readers'' sentiment towards factual (objective) content and towards its entities (subject and object). ACT is a theory of affective reasoning that uses empirically derived equations to predict the sentiments and emotions that arise from events. This theory relies on several large lexicons of words with affective ratings in a three-dimensional space of evaluation, potency, and activity (EPA). The equations and lexicons of ACT were evaluated on a newly collected news-headlines corpus. ACT lexicon was expanded using a label propagation algorithm, resulting in 86,604 new words. The predicted emotions for each news headline was then computed using the augmented lexicon and ACT equations. The results had a precision of 82%, 79%, and 68% towards the event, the subject, and object, respectively. These results are significantly higher than those of standard sentiment analysis techniques.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>Words are polysemous. However, most approaches to representation learning for lexical semantics assign a single vector to every surface word type. Meanwhile, lexical ontologies such as WordNet provide a source of complementary knowledge to distributional information, including a word sense inventory. In this paper we propose two novel and general approaches for generating sense-specific word embeddings that are grounded in an ontology. The first applies graph smoothing as a post-processing step to tease the vectors of different senses apart, and is applicable to any vector space model. The second adapts predictive maximum likelihood models that learn word embeddings with latent variables representing senses grounded in an specified ontology. Empirical results on lexical semantic tasks show that our approaches effectively captures information from both the ontology and distributional statistics. Moreover, in most cases our sense-specific models outperform other models we compare against.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>Sparse representations of text such as bag-of-words models or extended explicit semantic analysis (ESA) representations are commonly used in many NLP applications. However, for short texts, the similarity between two such sparse vectors is not accurate due to the small term overlap. While there have been multiple proposals for dense representations of words, measuring similarity between short texts (sentences, snippets, paragraphs) requires combining these token level similarities. In this paper, we propose to combine ESA representations and word2vec representations as a way to generate denser representations and, consequently, a better similarity measure between short texts. We study three densification mechanisms that involve aligning sparse representation via many-to-many, many-to-one, and one-to-one mappings. We then show the effectiveness of these mechanisms on measuring similarity between short texts.</p>'

However, while the discourse on content analysis centers heavily on reproducibility, computer scientists often focus more on scalability and less on coding reliability, leading to growing skepticism on the usefulness of topic models for automated content analysis. In response, we introduce TopicCheck, an interactive tool for assessing topic model stability. Our contributions are threefold. First, from established guidelines on reproducible content analysis, we distill a set of design requirements on how to computationally assess the stability of an automated coding process. Second, we devise an interactive alignment algorithm for matching latent topics from multiple models, and enable sensitivity evaluation across a large number of models. Finally, we demonstrate that our tool enables social scientists to gain novel insights into three active research questions.</p>'

We introduce three new techniques to tackle these problems. First, we design the first linear-time incremental shift-reduce-style semantic parsing algorithm which is more efficient than conventional cubic-time bottom-up semantic parsers. Second, our parser, being type-driven instead of syntax-driven, uses type-checking to decide the direction of reduction, which eliminates the need for a syntactic grammar such as CCG. Third, to fully exploit the power of type-driven semantic parsing beyond simple types (such as entities and truth values), we borrow from programming language theory the concepts of subtype polymorphism and parametric polymorphism to enrich the type system in order to better guide the parsing. Our system learns very accurate parses in \eGeoQuery, Jobs and Atis domains.</p>"

However, it is still expensive to obtain the millions of translations that are needed to train statistical machine translation systems. We propose two mechanisms to reduce the cost of crowdsourcing while maintaining high translation quality. First, we develop a method to reduce redundant translations. We train a linear model to evaluate the translation quality on a sentence-by-sentence basis, and fit a threshold between acceptable and unacceptable translations. Unlike past work, which always paid for a fixed number of translations for each source sentence and then chose the best from them, we can stop earlier and pay less when we receive a translation that is good enough. Second, we introduce a method to reduce the pool of translators by quickly identifying bad translators after they have translated only a few sentences. This also allows us to rank translators, so that we re-hire only good translators to reduce cost.</p>'

We propose two inexpensive methods for training alignment models solely using free text, by generating artificial question-answer pairs from discourse structures. Our approach is driven by two representations of discourse: a shallow sequential representation, and a deep one based on Rhetorical Structure Theory. We evaluate the proposed model on two corpora from different genres and domains: one from Yahoo! Answers and one from the biology domain, and two types of non-factoid questions: manner and reason.

Experimental results show that AMR captures contextual properties discriminative enough to make linking decisions, without the need for EL training data, and that system with AMR parsing output outperforms hand labeled traditional semantic roles as context representation for EL.

    'abstract': '<p>Matrix factorization approaches to relation extraction provide several attractive features: they support distant supervision, handle open schemas, and leverage unlabeled data. Unfortunately, these methods share a shortcoming with all other distantly supervised approaches: they cannot learn to extract target relations without existing data in the knowledge base, and likewise, these models are inaccurate for relations with sparse data. Rule-based extractors, on the other hand, can be easily extended to novel relations and improved for existing but inaccurate relations, through first-order formulae that capture auxiliary domain knowledge. However, usually a large set of such formulae is necessary to achieve generalization.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a paradigm for learning low-dimensional embeddings of entity-pairs and relations that combine the advantages of matrix factorization with first-order logic domain knowledge. We introduce simple approaches for estimating such embeddings, as well as a novel training algorithm to jointly optimize over factual and first-order logic information. Our results show that this method is able to learn accurate extractors with little or no distant supervision alignments, while at the same time generalizing to textual patterns that do not appear in the formulae.</p>'

Evaluation in word relatedness and similarity datasets yields equal or better results than those of a random walk algorithm, using a dense representation (300 dimensions instead of 117K). Furthermore, the word representations are complementary to those of the random walk algorithm and to corpus-based continuous representations, improving the state-of-the-art in the similarity dataset.

Previous work attacked this problem by inducing new translation rules from monolingual data with a semi-supervised algorithm. However, this approach does not scale very well since it is very computationally expensive to generate new translation rules for only a few thousand sentences. We propose a much faster and simpler method that directly hallucinates translation rules for infrequent phrases based on phrases with similar continuous representations for which a translation is known. To speed up the retrieval of similar phrases, we investigate approximated nearest neighbor search with redundant bit vectors which we find to be three times faster and significantly more accurate than locality sensitive hashing. Our approach of learning new translation rules improves a phrase-based baseline by up to 1.6 BLEU on Arabic-English translation, it is three-orders of magnitudes faster than existing semi-supervised methods and 0.5 BLEU more accurate.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>This paper studies how to incorporate the external word correlation knowledge to improve the coherence of topic modeling. Existing topic models assume words are generated independently and lack the mechanism to utilize the rich similarity relationships among words to learn coherent topics. To solve this problem, we build a Markov Random Field (MRF) regularized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, which define a MRF on the latent topic layer of LDA to encourage words labeled as similar to share the same topic label. Under our model, the topic assignment of each word is not independent, but rather affected by the topic labels of its correlated words. Similar words have better chance to be put into the same topic due to the regularization of MRF, hence the coherence of topics can be boosted. In addition, our model can accommodate the subtlety that whether two words are similar depends on which topic they appear in, which allows word with multiple senses to be put into different topics properly. We derive a variational inference method to infer the posterior probabilities and learn model parameters and present techniques to deal with the hard-to-compute partition function in MRF. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p>'

In this paper, we propose a lightly supervised approach based on label regularization to infer the age, ethnicity, and political orientation of Twitter users. Our approach learns from a heterogeneous collection of soft constraints derived from Census demographics, trends in baby names, and Twitter accounts that are emblematic of class labels. To counteract the imprecision of such constraints, we compare several constraint selection algorithms that optimize classification accuracy on a tuning set. We find that using no user-annotated data, our approach is within 2% of a fully supervised baseline for three of four tasks. Using a small set of labeled data for tuning further improves accuracy on all tasks.</p>'

We focus on a variety of ways to exploit phrase tables generated using multiple pivots to support a direct source-target phrase table. Our main method uses the Multiple Decoding Paths (MDP) feature of Moses, which we empirically verify as the best compared to the other methods we used. We compare and contrast our various results to show that one can overcome the limitations of small corpora by using as many pivot languages as possible in a multilingual setting. Most importantly, we show that such pivoting aids in learning of additional phrase pairs which are not learned when the direct source-target corpus is small. We obtained improvements of up to 3 BLEU points using multiple pivots for Japanese to Hindi translation compared to when only one pivot is used.

We propose a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for tree trimming problems whose running time is O(NL log N), where N is the number of tree nodes and L is the length limit. Our algorithm exploits the zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD), a data structure that represents a family of sets as a directed acyclic graph, to represent the set of subtrees in a compact form; the structure of ZDD permits the application of DP to obtain exact solutions, and our algorithm is applicable to different tree trimming problems.

    'abstract': '<p>Recently, there has been increasing interest in learning semantic parsers with indirect supervision, but existing work focuses almost exclusively on question answering. Separately, there have been active pursuits in leveraging databases for distant supervision in information extraction, yet such methods are often limited to binary relations and none can handle nested events. In this paper, we generalize distant supervision to complex knowledge extraction, by proposing the first approach to learn a semantic parser for extracting nested event structures without annotated examples, using only a database of such complex events and unannotated text. The key idea is to model the annotations as latent variables, and incorporate a prior that favors semantic parses containing known events. Experiments on the GENIA event extraction dataset show that our approach can learn from and extract complex biological pathway events. Moreover, when supplied with just five example words per event type, it becomes competitive even among supervised systems, outperforming 19 out of 24 teams that participated in the original shared task.</p>'

In contrast to typical representations based on neighboring words, a recently proposed approach suggests to represent a context of a target word by a substitute vector, comprising the potential fillers for the target word slot in that context. In this work we first propose a variant of substitute vectors, which we find particularly suitable for measuring context similarity.

While joint modeling of these tasks addresses the issue of error propagation inherent in traditional pipeline architectures, it also complicates the inference task. Past research has addressed this challenge by placing constraints on the scoring function. In contrast, we propose an approach that can handle arbitrarily complex scoring functions. Specifically, we employ a randomized greedy algorithm that jointly predicts segmentations, POS tags and dependency trees. Moreover, this architecture readily handles different segmentation tasks, such as morphological segmentation for Arabic and word segmentation for Chinese.

The motivation behind the approach is to automatically induce a compact feature representation for words and their relations, tailoring them to the task. In this sense, our dimensionality reduction method provides a clear alternative to the traditional feature engineering approach used in SRL. To capture meaningful interactions between the argument, predicate, their syntactic path and the corresponding role label, we compress each feature representation first to a lower dimensional space prior to assessing their interactions. This corresponds to using an overall cross-product feature representation and maintaining associated parameters as a four-way low-rank tensor. The tensor parameters are optimized for the SRL performance using standard online algorithms. Our tensor-based approach rivals the best performing system on the CoNLL-2009 shared task. In addition, we demonstrate that adding the representation tensor to a competitive tensor-free model yields 2\% absolute increase in F-score.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>Gradable terms such as brief, lengthy and extended illustrate varying degrees of a scale and can therefore participate in comparative constructs. Knowing the set of words that can be compared on the same scale and the associated ordering between them (brief < lengthy < extended) is very useful for a variety of lexical semantic tasks. Current techniques to derive such an ordering rely on WordNet to determine which words belong on the same scale and are limited to adjectives. Here we describe an extension to recent work: we investigate a fully automated pipeline to extract gradable terms from a corpus, group them into clusters reflecting the same scale and establish an ordering among them. This methodology reduces the amount of required handcrafted knowledge, and can infer gradability of words independent of their part of speech. Our approach infers an ordering for adjectives with comparable performance to previous work, but also for adverbs with an accuracy of 71%. We find that the technique is useful for inferring such rankings among words across different domains, and present an example using biomedical text.</p>'

These concepts are often obtained by selecting bigrams from the documents. In this paper, we improve such bigram based ILP summarization methods from different aspects. First we use syntactic information to select more important bigrams. Second, to estimate the importance of the bigrams, in addition to the internal features based on the test documents (e.g., document frequency, bigram positions), we propose to extract features by leveraging multiple external resources (such as word embedding from additional corpus,Wikipedia, Dbpedia,Word-Net, SentiWordNet). The bigram weights are then trained discriminatively in a joint learning model that predicts the bigram weights and selects the summary sentences in the ILP framework at the same time. We demonstrate that our system consistently outperforms the prior ILP method on different TAC data sets, and performs competitively compared to other previously reported best results. We also conducted various analysis to show the contribution of different components.</p>'

The performance bottleneck of a discourse parser comes from implicit discourse relations, whose discourse connectives are not overtly present. Explicit discourse connectives can potentially be exploited to collect more training data to collect more data and boost the performance. However, using them indiscriminately has been shown to hurt the performance because not all discourse connectives can be dropped arbitrarily. Based on this insight, we investigate the interaction between discourse connectives and the discourse relations and propose the criteria for selecting the discourse connectives that can be dropped independently of the context without changing the interpretation of the discourse. Extra training data collected only by the freely omissible connectives improve the performance of the system without additional features.</p>'

We propose features to mitigate these errors and evaluate the impact of ASR errors on entity linking using a new corpus of entity linked broadcast news transcripts.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>If speakers use language rationally, they should structure their messages to achieve approximately uniform information density (UID), in order to optimize transmission via a noisy channel. Previous work identified a consistent increase in linguistic information across sentences in text as a signature of the UID hypothesis. This increase was derived from a predicted increase in context, but the context itself was not quantified. We use microblog texts from Twitter, tied to a single shared event (the baseball World Series), to quantify both linguistic and non-linguistic context. By tracking changes in contextual information, we predict and identify gradual and rapid changes in information content in response to in-game events. These findings lend further support to the UID hypothesis and highlights the importance of non-linguistic common ground for language production and processing.</p>'

Our proposed probabilistic model allows us to estimate translation probabilities that are conditioned on the whole source document. The assumption of our probabilistic model is that each document can be characterized by a distribution over topics that help to solve the translation ambiguity of single words. Using the derived translation probabilities, we then calculate the expected word frequency of each word type in the target language.

This paper attempts to nudge the discussion from identifying some relations to all relations. We present new experiments on strongly connected event graphs that contain \u223C10 times more relations per document than the TimeBank. We also describe a shift away from the single learner to a sieve-based architecture that naturally blends multiple learners into a precision-ranked cascade of sieves. Each sieve adds labels to the event graph one at a time, and earlier sieves inform later ones through transitive closure. This paper thus describes innovations in both approach and task.

They are called Input and Output Strictly Local (ISL and OSL). We provide an automata-theoretic characterization of the ISL class and theorems establishing how the classes are related to each other and to Strictly Local languages. We give evidence that local phonological and morphological processes belong to these classes. Finally we provide a learning algorithm which provably identifies the class of ISL functions in the limit from positive data in polynomial time and data. We demonstrate this learning result on appropriately synthesized artificial corpora. We leave a similar learning result for OSL functions for future work and suggest future directions for addressing non-local phonological processes.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>Little work from the Natural Language Processing community has targeted the role of quantities in Natural Language Understanding. This paper takes some key steps towards facilitating reasoning about quantities expressed in natural language. We investigate two different tasks of numerical reasoning. First, we consider Quantity Entailment, a new task formulated to understand the role of quantities in general textual inference tasks. Second, we consider the problem of automatically understanding and solving elementary school math word problems. In order to address these quantitative reasoning problems we first develop a computational approach which we show to successfully recognize and normalize textual expressions of quantities. We then use these capabilities to further develop algorithms to assist reasoning in the context</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>Inferring the information structure of scientific documents is useful for many NLP applications. Existing approaches to this task require substantial human effort. We propose a framework for constraint learning that reduces human involvement considerably. Our model uses topic models to identify latent topics and their key linguistic features in input documents, induces constraints from this information and maps sentences to their dominant information structure categories through a constrained unsupervised model. When the induced constraints are combined with a fully unsupervised model, the resulting model challenges existing lightly supervised feature-based models as well as unsupervised models that use manually constructed declarative knowledge. Our results demonstrate that useful declarative knowledge can be learned from data with very limited human involvement.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>Word sense induction (WSI) seeks to automatically discover the senses of a word in a corpus via unsupervised methods. We propose a sense-topic model for WSI, which treats sense and topic as two separate latent variables to be inferred jointly. Topics are informed by the entire document, while senses are informed by the local context surrounding the ambiguous word. We also discuss unsupervised ways of enriching the original corpus in order to improve model performance, including using neural word embeddings and external corpora to expand the context of each data instance. We demonstrate significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art, achieving the best results reported to date on the SemEval-2013 WSI task.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>Prepositional phrase (PP) attachment disambiguation is a known challenge in syntactic parsing. The lexical sparsity associated with PP attachments motivates research in word representations that can capture pertinent syntactic and semantic features of the word. One promising solution is to use word vectors induced from large amounts of raw text. However, state-of-the-art systems that employ such representations yield modest gains in PP attachment accuracy. In this paper, we show that word vector representations can yield significant PP attachment performance gains. This is achieved via a non-linear architecture that is discriminatively trained to maximize PP attachment accuracy. The architecture is initialized with word vectors trained from unlabeled data, and relearns those to maximize attachment accuracy. We obtain additional performance gains with alternative representations such as dependency-based word vectors. When tested on both English and Arabic datasets, our method outperforms both a strong SVM classifier and state-of-the-art parsers. For instance, we achieve 82.6% PP attachment accuracy on Arabic, while the Turbo and Charniak self-trained parsers obtain 76.7% and 80.8% respectively.</p>'

We explore whether web links can replace a curated encyclopaedia, obtaining entity prior, name, context, and coherence models from a corpus of web pages with links to Wikipedia. Experiments compare web link models to Wikipedia models on well-known CoNLL and TAC data sets. Results show that using 34 million web links approaches Wikipedia performance. Combining web link and Wikipedia models produces the best-known disambiguation accuracy of 88.7 on standard newswire test data.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>We present MultiP (Multi-instance Learning Paraphrase Model), a new model suited to identify paraphrases within the short messages on Twitter. We jointly model paraphrase relations between word and sentence pairs and assume only sentence-level annotations during learning. Using this principled latent variable model alone, we achieve the performance competitive with a state-of-the-art method which combines a latent space model with a feature-based supervised classifier. Our model also captures lexically divergent paraphrases that differ from yet complement previous methods; combining our model with previous work significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. In addition, we present a novel annotation methodology that has allowed us to crowdsource a paraphrase corpus from Twitter. We make this new dataset available to the research community.</p>'

    'abstract': '<p>Grammars for machine translation can be materialized on demand by finding source phrases in an indexed parallel corpus and extracting their translations. This approach is limited in practical applications by the computational expense of online lookup and extraction. For phrase-based models, recent work has shown that on-demand grammar extraction can be greatly accelerated by parallelization on general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs), but these algorithms do not work for hierarchical models, which require matching patterns that contain gaps. We address this limitation by presenting a novel GPU algorithm for on-demand hierarchical grammar extraction that is at least an order of magnitude faster than a comparable CPU algorithm when processing large batches of sentences. In terms of end-to-end translation, with decoding on the CPU, we increase throughput by roughly two thirds on a standard MT evaluation dataset. The GPU necessary to achieve these improvements increases the cost of a server by about a third. We believe that GPU-based extraction of hierarchical grammars is an attractive proposition, particularly for MT applications that demand high throughput.</p>'
