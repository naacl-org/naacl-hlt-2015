## Abstract

What effect does language have on people?

You might say in response, "Who are you to discuss this problem?"
and you would be right to do so; this is a Major Question that
science has been tackling for many years. But as a field, I think
natural language processing and computational linguistics have much
to contribute to the conversation, and I hope to encourage the
community to further address these issues.

This talk will focus on the effect of phrasing, emphasizing aspects
that go beyond just the selection of one particular word over
another.  The issues we'll consider include: Does the way in which
something is worded in and of itself have an effect on whether it
is remembered or attracts attention, beyond its content or context?
Can we characterize how different sides in a debate frame their
arguments, in a way that goes beyond specific lexical choice (e.g.,
"pro-choice" vs. "pro-life")?  The settings we'll explore range
from movie quotes that achieve cultural prominence; to posts on
Facebook, Wikipedia, Twitter, and the arXiv; to framing in public
discourse on the inclusion of genetically-modified organisms in
food.

## Biography

Lillian Lee is a professor of computer science and of information
science at Cornell University, and the co-Editor-in-Chief, together
with Michael Collins, of Transactions of the ACL.  Her research
interests include natural language processing and computational
social science. She is the recipient of the inaugural Best Paper
Award at HLT-NAACL 2004 (joint with Regina Barzilay), a citation
in "Top Picks: Technology Research Advances of 2004" by Technology
Research News (also joint with Regina Barzilay), and an Alfred P.
Sloan Research Fellowship; and in 2013, she was named a Fellow of
the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence
(AAAI). Her group's work has received several mentions in the popular
press, including The New York Times, NPR's All Things Considered,
and NBC's The Today Show, and one of her co-authored papers was
publicly called "boring" by Youtubers Rhett and Link,  in a video
viewed over 1.8 million times.
