The [program schedule](schedule.html) has been updated. In addition the schedule now contains additional information including the session chairs for each session and the room information at the venue. Note that sessions 2A and 3A do not have a break in between and so a single session chair will be responsible for these two sessions (the same caveat applies to session 2B, 2B and session 2C, 3C).
